# EventLoop_JS
Implementing Event Loop in JavaScript(JS)

The event loop is a crucial concept in JavaScript, particularly in the context of asynchronous programming. It is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. Let's break down the components of the event loop:

1. **Call Stack:**
   - The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in your code. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack, and when it completes, it is popped off. The call stack manages the execution context of your code.

2. **Web APIs:**
   - Web APIs are provided by the browser environment and include functions like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, and `XMLHttpRequest`. When you use these functions, the corresponding tasks are offloaded to the browser's Web APIs.

3. **Callback Queue:**
   - When a Web API task is completed, it places a callback in the callback queue. The callback queue holds functions that are ready to be executed. These functions are waiting for the call stack to be empty so they can be moved to the stack.

4. **Event Loop:**
   - The event loop is a continuous process that constantly checks the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the stack, starting the execution of that function.

**How the Event Loop Works:**

1. **Execution Starts:**
   - When you run a JavaScript script, the main script starts executing. Functions are pushed onto the call stack, and their execution begins.

2. **Web API Tasks:**
   - When a function like `setTimeout` is encountered, it is handed off to the browser's Web API, allowing other code to continue execution without waiting for the timeout to complete.

3. **Callback Queue:**
   - Once a Web API task is completed (e.g., the timeout is reached), its callback is placed in the callback queue.

4. **Event Loop Checks:**
   - The event loop continually checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack.

5. **Execution Continues:**
   - The callback function from the queue is now executed. This process repeats, allowing asynchronous tasks to be handled without blocking the main thread.

**Key Points:**
- JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it executes one operation at a time.
- The event loop enables non-blocking asynchronous behavior by delegating time-consuming tasks to Web APIs and handling their completion asynchronously.
- Callbacks and Promises play a crucial role in working with asynchronous code within the event loop.
